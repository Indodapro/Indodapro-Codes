            Description:
                There was no reason to make this but i just decided to. The image itself has 3 numbers at the start of the file, there are for 'Width', 'Height' and 'Pixel_Density' in that order, also thats the named given to the variables in the code. Starting on line 4 is the RGB values, there is not realty a limit to how many you want, pygame will just draw them off screen. I tryed to make a command promt argument so that you could specify the file path upon opening but for now you just have to update the path manualy in the 'ipx_opener.py'. IPX stands for 'Indodapro Pixel'. The test image is very bad, I might try to make a .png converter or something later but for now you're on your own. Thanks, Indodapro.
            Use:
                Change the 'File_Path' variable in the code the real file path of your Test.ipx

                Keeping in mind that the pixels are drawn from right to left based width ('Width' is the first line in the 'Test.ipx'), height ('Height' is the second line in the 'Test.ipx') and pixel size ('Pixel_Size' is the third line in the 'Test.ipx) you can now begin to edit the RGB values and create as many as you want

                Good luck!
